# React Box Generator
---------------------

This is a simple React webpage that I created for my Intro to GUI Programming class. The purpose was to practice using functional components and hooks as part of a responsive React page.

The desired amount of boxes will be displayed. Even, odd and prime numbered boxes are distinctly colored. When selected, a box will be added to a sorted list component.
